Video URL:
Description: The Project above is a purchasing system consisting of Age, Estimated alary and Gender
The project started with a Heading tagged purchasing system
above it is the jpeg image
the purchasing system is programmed in uch a way that once the user enters his or her age and the estimated salary and gender inclusive
it brings out a prmopt command which is make prediction
if the estimated salary is inputed in the make prediction 
It brings out two options the customer is likely to purchase and if not it shows the customer is not likely to predict
so its just a prediction purchase system that grant you the access to purchase an item
So once the prediction is made it is automatically stored in the system
In Essence its a prediction system that helps you to store your salary which you can use to purchae items over a long time
I also made use of a local host file to host that which was designed
